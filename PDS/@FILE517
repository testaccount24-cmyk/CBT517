//***FILE 517 is from Peter Flass and contains XPL, which is a      *   FILE 517
//*           compiler generator system that was developed in the   *   FILE 517
//*           late 60s.  Most of the source is in its own language, *   FILE 517
//*           which looks like PL/I.  There is an assembler driver  *   FILE 517
//*           system, that allows installation of the rest of the   *   FILE 517
//*           code.                                                 *   FILE 517

//*   Some further remarks from Peter:                              *   FILE 517
//*                                                                 *   FILE 517
//*      XPL is a standalone system - a self-compiling compiler.    *   FILE 517
//*      It doesn't need PL/I, and that's why the source uses       *   FILE 517
//*      all 80 columns of the cards.                               *   FILE 517
//*                                                                 *   FILE 517
//*      My packaging assumed that the file would be downloaded     *   FILE 517
//*      by a browser, unpacked on a PC, and then uploaded to a     *   FILE 517
//*      mainframe.  The EBCDIC files should be uploaded as FB      *   FILE 517
//*      80 (any blksize).  The binary files should be uploaded     *   FILE 517
//*      as F 3600.  The user has to assemble the "submonitor",     *   FILE 517
//*      and then use it to load and run the binaries.  All the     *   FILE 517
//*      JCL is in PROSE.  Naturally it needed to be modified,      *   FILE 517
//*      but I don't think the modifications I had to make for      *   FILE 517
//*      my system would improve any on what's there.               *   FILE 517
//*                                                                 *   FILE 517
